# MRI4ALL Hackathon 2023

Here you can find all source code that was developed during the MRI4ALL Hackathon 2023 that took place from October 16-21, 2023 in New York City. Goal of the hackathon was to jointly develop a fully-fledged open-source low-field MRI scanner. Over the coming weeks, we will complete the repositories and include all tools for calculating the magnet placement, gradient coils, shims, and the developed console software.
