# MRI4ALL Hackathon 2023

Here you can find all source code that was developed during the MRI4ALL Hackathon 2023 that took place from October 16-21, 2023 in New York City. Goal of the hackathon was to jointly develop a fully-fledged open-source low-field MRI scanner. Over the coming weeks, we will complete the repositories and include all tools for calculating the magnet placement, gradient coils, shims, and the developed console software.

## About the MRI4ALL Hackathon

Goal of the MRI4ALL Hackathon, which took place from October 16 - 21, 2023 in NYC, was to develop a fully-fledged low-field MRI scanner in just 4 days and to release all developed resources, such as the software for controlling the scanner and for calculating the magnet construction, as open-source software. In this GitHub workspace, you will find all resources shared so far. Over the next weeks, we will add the further components (such as the STL files for 3D-printing the scanner parts).
